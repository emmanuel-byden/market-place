## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com/) with a Firestore database setup

---

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ezekielkibiego/market-place
   cd market-place
2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install

3. Set up Firebase

    - **Create a Firebase project** in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - **Enable Firestore** in the **Build > Firestore Database** section.
    - Add your Firebase configuration to a new file `Firebase.js` in the project root:

       ```javascript
       import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
       import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

       const firebaseConfig = {
         apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
         authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
         projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
         storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
         messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
         appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
       };

       const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
       const db = getFirestore(app);

       export { db };

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    npm run dev


The app will be available at 
    <a href="http://localhost:5173" target="_blank">http://localhost:5173 </a>


## Firestore Rules

For development, set Firestore rules to allow read and write operations:

⚠️ Update the rules for production to secure your database.


## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Add products using the input fields and "Add Product" button.
3. Edit or delete products using the respective buttons next to each product.
4. All changes are reflected dynamically in the Firebase Firestore database.
